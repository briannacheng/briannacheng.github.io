## Resources on Asian-Indigenous Relations

ChangeLab. “A Different Asian American Timeline.” Accessed March 10, 2021. https://aatimeline.com/comments

- This list includes resources focused on Asian-Indigenous relations in both “Canada” and “the United States.” Despite differing colonial governments, the conceptualization of Asian-Indigenous relations across Turtle Island are fruitful to discussions about Montreal Chinatown. Colonial borders do not bifurcate lived experiences; for instance, much of Manu Karuka’s Empire’s Tracks, a monograph which examines the building of the Transcontinental Railroad through the histories of colonialism and capitalism, is applicable to the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway.

## Acknowledgements

In conducting my research, I have been privileged to speak to numerous community members, activists, artists, and scholars who have afforded me knowledge, guidance, and hope. Thank you to Janet Lumb, Mei Chiu, Parker Mah, Yen-Chao Lin, Jimmy Chan, William Dere, Donny Seto, Jessica Chen, and Walter Chi-Yan-Tom.

Thank you to my best friend Chris Krofchak for helping me code this beautiful website. You’re a genius.

Thank you to Serene Mitchell for helping me talk out my ideas whenever I was stressed. Cannot wait to hug you in person.

This project would not be possible without the support of the BLUE internship program. The Building 21 staff believed in the potential of all of their interns in a world where student research is too often devalued and diminished. Thank you to my internship cohort for conversations that make my brain hurt in the best way.

With solidary,

Brianna Cheng
