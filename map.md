Below is a map which highlights significant locales in the past and present of Montreal Chinatown. The map includes both locations that are still standing, and locations that were once part of Chinatown but no longer “exist,” often due to expropriation of land and gentrification. The descriptions and analyses accompanying each site focuses specifically on histories of race, class, resistance, and the demands outlined in "Organizing the Future.” By no means is this map comprehensive—there are countless societies and heritage sites that are not currently showcased. However, “Beyond Survival” is an ongoing project that aims to continue documenting the past and present of Chinatown. After all, Montreal Chinatown deserves long-term exploration and public interest. Please contact us if you are interested in highlighting a specific spot that is not yet on the map, or if there is any additional information that would be helpful to add to any existing descriptions.
