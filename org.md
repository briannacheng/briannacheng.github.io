Montreal Chinatown is facing a myriad of internal and external threats. To combat this precarity, it is useful to imagine a prospective Chinatown beyond survival, one that adequately serves the diverse needs of residents and community members. In his book Being Chinese in Canada: The Struggle for Identity, Redress, and Belonging, William Dere wrote that sociologist Kwok Chan told him that “a survey was done to show that the Montreal Chinese community would be the least likely to protest urban encroachment by the different levels of government.” Evidently, the model minority myth—which assumes that Asian Canadians are politically meek—was weaponized to displace Chinatown’s residents. In reality, there has been a long history of Chinese-Canadian resistance and political activism. Currently, multiple organizations—including the Chinatown working group, the Progressive Chinese of Quebec, family associations, and student organizations—are advocating for the neighborhood.

In the past weeks, I have conducted conversations with several community activists and groups. I have listed their most common demands for Chinatown below:

1. An end to gentrification, displacement, and development projects that are irrelevant to the heritage of Chinatown
2. Create community spaces and cultural institutions, like green spaces and a new cultural centre
3. Invest in heritage preservation and long-term research on Chinatown to bring forward overlooked narratives
4. Centre transparency, accountability, and community participation
5. Focus on the most vulnerable community members in community decision making
